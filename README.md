## Introduction


In modern digital and communication systems, oscillators play a critical role in generating clock signals for synchronization and timing control. Among various types of oscillators, ring oscillators are particularly popular due to their simplicity, ease of integration, and flexibility in tuning frequency. A ring oscillator consists of an odd number of inverting stages connected in a loop, producing a periodic oscillating signal. As technology nodes shrink and device dimensions scale down, the design of ring oscillators becomes increasingly complex, especially when implemented at advanced process nodes such as 90nm technology.
At the 90nm scale, challenges such as power consumption, device variability, and susceptibility to faults become more pronounced. In such scenarios, ensuring fault tolerance in the design becomes crucial to maintaining the circuit's performance and reliability. Fault-tolerant delay cells, when integrated into the ring oscillator, help mitigate the effects of device failures, process variations, and environmental disturbances, thus enhancing the overall robustness of the circuit. This research focuses on the design and implementation of a ring oscillator at 90nm technology using fault-tolerant delay cells to achieve high reliability, stability, and performance, making it suitable for use in advanced digital systems. The project aims to address both the technical challenges posed by the reduced feature size of 90nm technology and the need for dependable performance in critical applications.

## Materials & Methods


In this experiment, Cadence Virtuoso was utilized to design, simulate, and analyze the performance of a ring oscillator at 90nm technology, incorporating fault-tolerant delay cells to enhance circuit reliability, with careful consideration of process variations and device
 Characteristics.


## Result & Discussion
The proposed circuits of the delay cell are designed using 90nm CMOS Technology in Cadence Virtuoso software. The structure is implemented using the TMR Topology and Quad-rippled Topology. Power consumption for the fault-tolerant delay cell has been calculated. Before starting the actual design, it is important to fix the length of the device. Thus, the length selected for the design is L = 90nm, since the technology file used here is cmos_models_90nm.

The fault tolerant delay cell is powered by supply voltage of 1V. Primary and secondary input voltages vary between 0 to 1V. Vctrl1 and Vctrl2 are two control signals which vary from 0 to 1V, used for the purpose of fine tuning and coarse tuning respectively. In transient analysis, signals are applied through two different pair of inputs i.e. primary and secondary input. Secondary inputs (Vs+ and Vs−) are applied to PMOS transistor M3 and M4. Primary inputs (Vp+ and Vp−) are applied to NMOS transistor M1 and M2. As switching time of PMOS is lower than that of NMOS with same geometry size, the secondary inputs receive the skewed delayed signals earlier than primary inputs. This will help to reduce the switching time of PMOS. The output voltage is taken from two different node Vout+ (positive output node) and Vout− (negative output node). The transient response obtained by simulating fault tolerance delay cell.


## Conclusion



In conclusion, the design and implementation of a ring oscillator using fault-tolerant delay cells at 90nm CMOS technology have demonstrated significant improvements in reliability and performance. The use of fault-tolerant delay cells, combined with TMR (Triple Modular Redundancy) and Quad-rippled Topologies, has effectively enhanced the circuit's robustness against potential faults, ensuring consistent performance even under challenging conditions. By optimizing the switching time between PMOS and NMOS transistors, the proposed design reduces delays and improves overall timing accuracy. The selection of a 45nm device length, aligned with the 90nm CMOS technology, further aids in minimizing power consumption and achieving efficient operation. The transient analysis and simulation results, conducted using Cadence Virtuoso, validate the effectiveness of the proposed design in generating reliable output with improved fault tolerance. This project presents a valuable contribution toward developing robust digital circuits that can operate effectively in fault-prone environments, making them suitable for critical applications in advanced electronic systems.
